# Silk Vocal Studio
All-in-One Python GUI for easily creating CV / CVVC / VCV voicebanks for the vocal synthesizer UTAU. Create base folder, record samples, auto generate the oto.ini and package in one go.

## Features
- Simple but modern PyQT5 GUI
- Create base folder with sample folder and `character.txt` for voicebank info
- Recording from a `reclist.txt` file
- Recording visualisation with `matplotlib`
- Automatic configuration of oto.ini file
- Packaging to zip

Info: This is currently in planning phase.

## Why Silk Vocal Studio?
Silk Vocal Studio removes the annoying process of needing to install multiple applications to create a voicebank, which includes the recording software (like OREMO or Recstar) and the oto.ini generator (setParam or MoreSampler) or editor (UTAU oto editor, vLabeler).
Silk Vocal Studio combines the main parts of making a UTAU voicebank and even makes it easy to package a voicebank to the final product.

## Requirements
- `PyQT5` (pip)
- `matplotlib` (pip)

## Running the program
To use this program, simply execute the `main.py` file directly via `python3`.
```
python3 main.py
```
