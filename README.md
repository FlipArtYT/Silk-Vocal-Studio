## ❓ Why Silk Vocal Studio?
Silk Vocal Studio removes the annoying process of needing to install multiple applications to create a voicebank, which includes the recording software (like OREMO or Recstar) and the oto.ini generator (setParam or MoreSampler) or editor (UTAU oto editor, vLabeler).
Silk Vocal Studio combines the main parts of making a UTAU voicebank and even makes it easy to package a voicebank to the final product.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- `PyQT5` (pip)
- `pyqtgraph` (pip)

## 🚀 Running the program
To use this program, simply execute the `main.py` file directly via `python3`.
